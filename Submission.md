# Starting the app

* To start the app in a Docker container, from your machine, run bin/docker_build.bash. The script will call bin/run.sh from the container.

* To start the app from the container (or possibly any suitable environment although that is untested), run the bin/run.sh file.
The app.db database file will be recreated if it doesn't exist.

* To check the coverage, run bin/coverage.sh: it will run the tests and open them in your default browser

# Design

* The approach taken is that the root path is a "mind-map creator". It's technically not part of any mind map and thus acts specially. AÂ mind map is actually a direct leaf to the root.
* The root node answers in plain text to GET requests (for pretty-printing, per Specification)
* Everything else answers strictly in JSON
